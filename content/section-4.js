In addition, having a travel plan and a 'buddy' to check in with can make it easier to deal with an emergency and trigger an escalation back at the office", "It's important to remind staff to know their rights when crossing borders, especially as laptop stickers, authentication keys and an unusually empty device are all elements that can make them look suspicious. Staff should also remember to stay calm and polite during border interactions as lying, rudeness and physical interference with an agent's search will not help the situation."]
